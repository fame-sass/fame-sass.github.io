## About Linz
Linz is a city nestled along the picturesque banks of the Danube River, with ~200.000 inhabitants.
It is roughly halfway between Salzburg and Vienna, about 1.5 hours by train/car. 
It has a significant historical legacy dating back to Roman times, 
but also a strong presence in the industrial and technological sectors and is known for its contemporary art scene.

One iconic landmark in Linz is the New Cathedral (Neuer Dom), 
a masterpiece of Gothic architecture that towers over the cityscape. 
For a glimpse into Linz’s artistic side, visit the Ars Electronica Center, a futuristic museum that explores the intersection of art, technology, and science with hands-on experiences. The charming Old Town (Altstadt) of Linz is a hotspot for historic buildings and cozy cafes. It connects to the Landstraße, the main shopping street of the city, which impresses with beautifully preserved facades of old merchants’ houses.
