**Abstract**
Modern software systems are complex, highly variable systems that frequently evolve. To address the requirements of different customers and markets, multiple variants are developed, very often relying on clone-and-own (code) reuse techniques. This is particularly true for software-intensive systems in industry. Driven by industry needs for a more systematic and scalable approach to reuse, a lot of research on dealing with variability has been conducted in the area of software product lines since the early 1990ies. Variability models are created in software product line approaches to model the commonalities and variability of software-intensive systems and to support deriving and configuring products based on these models. We will review the research landscape of model-based variability management. We will also have a look at recent trends and research, particularly, on managing variability in cyber-physical (production) systems, but also wrt general variability management challenges industry is still facing.
