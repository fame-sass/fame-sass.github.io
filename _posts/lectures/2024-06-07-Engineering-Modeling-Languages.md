**Abstract**
This course provides an end-to-end coverage of the engineering of modeling languages to turn domain knowledge into tools. 
It introduces the foundations of SLE, with a specific focus on the use of modeling techniques for designing and implementing DSLs. 
It also provides various illustrations through the definition of different kinds of modeling languages, their instrumentation with tools such as editors, 
interpreters and generators, the integration of multiple modeling languages to achieve a system view, and the validation of both models and tools.
