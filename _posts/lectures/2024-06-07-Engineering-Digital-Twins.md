**Abstract**
Digital twins are created as software systems to monitor, validate, simulate, optimize and predict the behavior, and control objects in the real world. Their engineering provides us with the opportunity to combine research on model-driven engineering, software architectures, models and simulation, data-driven approaches as well as model-based systems engineering. This course provides an overview about digital twin definitions, standards, and research on digital twin engineering methods. We will have a look into modeling methods for its engineering and during digital twin runtime, the combination with IoT data, and relevant functionalities digital twins can provide. In addition, this course gives an overview about existing technologies and tools.
