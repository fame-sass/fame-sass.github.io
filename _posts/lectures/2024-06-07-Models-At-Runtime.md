**Abstract**
In contrast to traditional software models, which focus on development time, runtime models are envisioned to provide intelligent support to software during execution. Runtime models can be used by the system itself, other systems, or humans to help cope with challenges such as those posed by self-adaptive systems. Runtime models can support reasoning and decision-making based on knowledge that may emerge at runtime but was not foreseen before execution to help deal with uncertainty. This talk will cover the support runtime models can provide to self-adaptive, autonomous systems and digital twins. We will share our experience building runtime model-based systems and discuss (partially) unaddressed challenges where runtime models can play a crucial role.
