**Abstract**
To become or not to become a scientist, that’s the question. Whether it’s nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of random futures, or to apply AI and human wisdom against this sea of troubles and thereby plan and obtain the future of your desires.
Based on experiences from 45 years in quite diverse jobs in research, we shall try and initiate discussions about what careers are and how they may or may not be designed.
