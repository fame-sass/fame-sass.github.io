**Abstract**
Labeled graphs are essential for the definition of abstract syntax for
software and system models. Consequently, several testing, benchmarking,
and optimization problems rely on the systematic construction of
consistent graph models. However, automatically generating a diverse set
of consistent graph models for industrial domains is challenging:
Firstly, we must specify the graph generation problem with mathematical
precision. Secondly, graph generation is computationally complex and
requires specialized logic solvers. The Refinery framework is an
open-source software tool that offers a high-level partial modeling
language and a scalable graph solver algorithm to tackle these
challenges. This hands-on session will show how to solve logic reasoning
problems about modeling languages with Refinery.
