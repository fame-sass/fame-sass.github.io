**Abstract**
In this talk, we discuss experiences gained by using low-code language Petriflow, based
on extended Petri nets enriched by data variables and forms. We illustrate in several real-life use
cases how the Petriflow models of business processes can directly be used as implementation when
deployed in the Petriflow interpreter.
